# Revit Linked Elements Management Scripts

This repository contains three Python scripts designed for **pyRevit**. Each script serves to manage linked Revit documents in different ways within the current Revit project environment. These scripts allow users to:

1. **Copy elements from selected linked Revit models into the current document.**
2. **Hide selected linked Revit models in the active view.**
3. **Unhide previously hidden linked Revit models in the active view.**

Together, these scripts provide efficient tools for controlling visibility and data management of linked Revit models within a project, streamlining workflows that involve handling linked structural and architectural elements.

## Script 1: Copy Elements from Linked Models

### Purpose

This script allows users to copy specific elements from selected linked Revit documents into the current project. Itâ€™s particularly useful when you need to reference structural elements from linked models, such as beams, columns, or foundations, in the active project environment.

### Workflow

1. **Collect Linked Documents**: The script first retrieves all linked Revit documents in the current project using `FilteredElementCollector` and `RevitLinkInstance`.
2. **User Selection of Links and Categories**: It then prompts the user to select the linked models and element categories they wish to copy.
3. **Filter Elements by Category**: Elements are filtered by the selected categories within each linked document.
4. **Copy Elements**: The filtered elements are copied into the current project, maintaining their original positions.
5. **Transaction Management**: The entire copy operation is handled within a Revit transaction to ensure model integrity.

### Key Methods

- `FilteredElementCollector.OfClass(RevitLinkInstance)`: Gathers linked documents.
- `forms.SelectFromList.show`: Presents a selection dialog for the user to choose links and categories.
- `ElementTransformUtils.CopyElements`: Copies elements from the linked model into the current document.

### Code Example

```python
collector = FilteredElementCollector(doc)
linkInstances = collector.OfClass(RevitLinkInstance).ToElements()

selected_link_name = forms.SelectFromList.show(
    link_options.keys(), title='Select Revit Links', width=500, height=400, button_name='Select Links', multiselect=True
)

# Filter and copy elements
element_ids = [link_instance.GetTypeId() for link_instance in selected_link_instances]
ElementTransformUtils.CopyElements(linkedDoc, element_ids, doc, transform, None)
